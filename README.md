Dido is my personal and very specific attempt on a text editor.

Status: early garbage.

- Parses `dub.json` in the current directory and opens all related files.
- No syntax coloration
- Multiple cursors are buggy
- Basic stuff is buggy

dido's internals were heavily inspired by kakoune, a much more advanced and general editor.
